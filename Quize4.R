#Question 1
#What is produced at the end of this snippet of R code?  	
set.seed(1)
rpois(5, 2)
#A vector with the numbers 1, 1, 2, 4, 1
#Because the `set.seed()' function is used, `rpois()' will always output the same vector in this code.

#Question 2
#What R function can be used to generate standard Normal random variables?
#rnorm
#Functions beginning with the `r' prefix are used to simulate random variates.

#Question 3
#When simulating data, why is using the set.seed() function important?
#It can be used to specify which random number generating algorithm R should use.
# It ensures that the sequence of random numbers is truly random.
#Question 4
#Which function can be used to evaluate the inverse cumulative distribution function for the Poisson distribution?
#qpois
#Probability distribution functions beginning with the `q' prefix are used to evaluate the quantile function.

#Question 5
#What does the following code do?		
set.seed(10)
x <- rbinom(10, 10, 0.5)
e <- rnorm(10, 0, 20)
y <- 0.5 + 2 * x + e
#Generate data from a Normal linear model

#Question 6
#What R function can be used to generate Binomial random variables?
#rbinom

#Question 7
#What aspect of the R runtime does the profiler keep track of when an R expression is evaluated?
#the function call stack

#Question 8
#Consider the following R code
library(datasets)
Rprof()
fit <- lm(y ~ x1 + x2)
Rprof(NULL)
#Assume that y, x1, and x2 are present in the workspace.) Without running the code, what percentage of the run time is spent 
#in the 'lm' function, based on the 'by.total' method of normalization shown in 'summaryRprof()'?
#100%
#When using `by.total' normalization, the top-level function (in this case, `lm()') always takes 100% of the time.

#Question 9
#When using 'system.time()', what is the user time?
#It is the time spent by the CPU evaluating an expression

#Question 10
#If a computer has more than one available processor and R is able to take advantage of that, then which of the following is 
#true when using 'system.time()'?
#elapsed time may be smaller than user time
